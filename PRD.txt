If you want to fetch comics and metadata automatically, 
you can use the JSON interface. The URLs look like this:

https://xkcd.com/info.0.json (current comic)

or:

https://xkcd.com/614/info.0.json (comic #614)

Those files contain, in a plaintext and easily-parsed format: comic titles,
URLs, post dates, transcripts (when available), and other metadata.

Create a webpage that is similar to TikTok with infinite scrolling.

Reference repo - https://github.com/IsaacGemal/wikitok/tree/main

Keep the code simple. Use only HTML, TailwindCSS and vanilla typescript.

Ensure each page displays only one image with num, day, month, year, title displayed in small text at the bottom.

Implementation Tips

Infinite Scrolling: You can load the next set of items (e.g., 10 or 20) via AJAX/fetch calls when the user nears the bottom of the page, mimicking TikTok’s endless feed.

Attribution and Limits: Many free APIs require attribution or have daily call limits. Be sure to read their usage guidelines.

Styling: Use a full-width background image with overlay text (title, description) for that cinematic, TikTok-style look. Add smooth vertical or horizontal scrolling.

Mix & Match: You can also combine multiple APIs (e.g., NASA images interspersed with random quotes or “fun facts” from Wikipedia) to create an eclectic or curated user experience.

Use the num from here - https://xkcd.com/info.0.json (current comic) to figure out how many total comics are available, then make a random call to any number between that and 1.

No server code. No back-end. Everything should be built in the front-end interface. Without using any complicated framework.
